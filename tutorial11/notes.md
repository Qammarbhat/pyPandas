The code imports the pandas library, reads a CSV file using read_csv function and assigns the resulting dataframe to variable df. Then it prints the original dataframe followed by a separator line.
# Melt
The `melt()` function in Pandas is used to transform or reshape a DataFrame by converting columns into rows. It unpivots a DataFrame from a wide format to a long format. The function takes in several arguments including the DataFrame to be melted, the columns to use as identifier variables, the name of the 'variable' column and the name of the 'value' column. The melted DataFrame has a row for each unique combination of identifier variables and the corresponding value.

## Reshaping using melt

Next, the melt function is used to reshape the df dataframe by melting it. The melted dataframe is stored in a new variable df1. The id_vars argument is used to specify the column(s) to be used as identifier variable(s) which will not be melted. In this case, it is set to "day" column.

## Filtering data

Several filter operations are performed on the melted dataframe df1. In each filter operation, the boolean expression is used as an index to filter rows of the dataframe. The resulting dataframe is then printed.

## Changing column names

Finally, the column names of the melted dataframe are changed using the var_name and value_name arguments of the melt function. The melted dataframe with new column names is printed.

# Stacking and Unstacking in Python
Stacking and unstacking are two important operations in data manipulation and reshaping in Pandas, a popular data analysis library for Python. They allow you to transform your data between "wide" and "long" formats, which can be useful for various purposes such as visualization, modeling, and analysis.

## Loading the data

The `pd.read_excel()` function is used to read an Excel file into a DataFrame. The argument `header=[0,1]` specifies that the first two rows of the Excel file should be used as the column headers.

## Stacking Header 1

`df.stack()` is applied to pivot the innermost level of column labels to the row index. The resulting DataFrame has a MultiIndex for its row index.

## Stacking First Level Header

`df.stack(level=0)` is applied to pivot the first level of column labels to the row index. This produces a DataFrame with a MultiIndex for its row index.

## Unstacking

`df2.unstack()` is applied to pivot the innermost level of row index to the column index. The resulting DataFrame has a single-level column index.

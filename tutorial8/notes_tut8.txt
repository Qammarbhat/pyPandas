Importing Libraries

    pandas library is imported with alias pd.

Creating Weather Dataframe for India

    A pandas DataFrame india_weather is created to store the weather information of Indian cities, which includes columns like city, temperature, and humidity.

Creating Weather Dataframe for USA

    A pandas DataFrame us_weather is created to store the weather information of US cities, which includes columns like city, temperature, and humidity.

Concatenating DataFrames as Rows

    pd.concat() function is used to concatenate india_weather and us_weather dataframes vertically, so that they are combined as rows.

Fixing the Index

    pd.concat() function is used with argument ignore_index=True to reset the index of the concatenated dataframe.

Keys Argument

    pd.concat() function is used with argument keys=["india", "us"] to add a hierarchical index to the concatenated dataframe.

Retrieving Data from Indian Cities

    df.loc["india"] is used to get the weather information of Indian cities only.

Concatenating DataFrames as Columns

    Two dataframes temperature_df and windspeed_df are concatenated horizontally using pd.concat() function with axis=1 argument.

Joining DataFrame with a Series

    A pandas series series is created to represent the weather condition for each city. It is concatenated with temperature_df dataframe horizontally using pd.concat() function with axis=1 argument.

Functions used in the code:

    pd.DataFrame(): To create a dataframe
    pd.concat(): To concatenate dataframes
    pd.Series(): To create a series
